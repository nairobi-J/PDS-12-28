# Task 1: Data Analysis and Visualization

This Jupyter Notebook (`Task1 (2).ipynb`) is part of the **PDS-12-28** repository and focuses on data analysis and visualization. It demonstrates how to load, clean, analyze, and visualize data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:
1. **Data Loading**: Loads a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creates visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms, scatter plots) to explore trends and patterns in the data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `numpy`.
- A dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nairobi-J/PDS-12-28.git
   cd PDS-12-28
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Task1 (2).ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   Execute the cells in the notebook step by step to perform data analysis and visualization.

## Notebook Sections

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Imports necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. **Load Dataset**:
   - Loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and corrects data inconsistencies.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzes the dataset to understand its structure, summary statistics, and key insights.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Creates visualizations to explore trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarizes the findings and insights from the analysis.

## Usage

- Replace the dataset path in the notebook with your own dataset.
- Modify the analysis and visualization steps as needed to suit your specific dataset and goals.

## Notes

- Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- Customize the visualizations to highlight the most important aspects of your data.
